# pme_eos-AP-poptracker
Archipelago tracker for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky

Every dungeon with missions available in it will have the amount of floors for missions generation counted.
Missions will generate based on either \<Floor Count\>/2 floored - \<Floor Count\> or 1 - \<Floor Count\> depending on where the development of the AP is.
As an example of this, Mt. Bristle has 9 floors, meaning that until generation for missions is set to be possible for floors 1 to 9, it will be availabe for floors 4 to 9.

Current issues:
- Bad or missing images

## NOTE

This tracker is not made for manual usage, please be warned that missions and outlaws will not be fun to track manually.
Events are also currently not checkable in manual mode, and will only be toggled with an Archipelago connection.
