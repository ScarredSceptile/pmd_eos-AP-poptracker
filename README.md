# pme_eos-AP-poptracker
Archipelago tracker for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky

Current issues:
- Bad or missing images
- Some logic does not update until an item is recieved (Clearing Beach Cave, Temporal Tower, Surrounded Sea and Miracle Sea)
	- This is so that the player does not think they have an item before they beat a dungeon in another place

## NOTE

This tracker is not made for manual usage, please be warned that missions and outlaws will not be fun to track manually.
